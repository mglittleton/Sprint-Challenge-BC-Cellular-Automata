1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.

A new piece of data is created (a transaction in Bitcoin, for example) and it's sent out to all miners in the network. Once a miner verifies the transaction, the transaction is added to the end of the linked list as a block that contains the hashed data and the previous hashed data.

2. How can blockchain users mine coins?

A miner hashes together guesses at a successful proof with the last proof and hopes that it meets the criteria required. If they fail, they guess again and see if that works. This continues until they are successful and then they are rewarded with additonal coins. This creates additional value in the overall system.

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.

Automata can be used to model real-world simple systems.
